Developement guide:

    First, make sure that you have [`git`](http://git-scm.com/downloads) on your computer. Create your own [fork](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/) of the repository, then clone it to your computer:

    git clone git@github.com:[YOUR GITHUB NAME]/expungement-dc.git

	You can work on the `master` branch (which is the default), but it's preferable to set up a new branch if you're working on a specific feature:

    git checkout -b [NEW BRANCH NAME]

To Do:
- Add Ineligible Felonies to Step #6 of the wizard
- Add eligible misdemeanor or an ineligible misdemeanor/felony #8
- Adding in additional steps that have not been completed based on the chart.
=======
-Add in a main page. Expunge.io is a great model to use. Two important notes: 1) Make sure to add in a section about  benefits-why you should seal your record. Feel free to add dummy comment and we can insert the 3 top reasons.  
-Add in an entire site easily translated into spanish. Check http://www.expunge.io/for example
-Add in a disclaimer page like this: http://www.expungemaryland.org/disclaimer
-Add in a page on getting your arrest information. This page is a good example, but the Options can easily be presented in vertical boxes as a way to improve design. Maybe the vertical goes can be clickable and lead to more information. Here’s an example: http://www.expungemaryland.org/step2. Don’t worry about the content, you can use dumb content. 
- Add Ineligible Felonies to Step #6 of the wizard
- Add eligible misdemeanor or an ineligible misdemeanor/felony #8
-Add comments to the code so it is obvious which each part of the code does. 
-Add in definitions for words that are not-commonly understood. Definitions can be found below.
